# Flight-Fare-Prediction
Created a model which can predict price where the
airline industry is highly competitive, with prices
fluctuating based on a multitude of factors such as
airline carrier, source and destination cities, flight
duration, number of stops, flight class, and the
number of days left until departure. Predicting flight
prices accurately can benefit various stakeholders,
including passengers, travel agencies, and airlines.
Passengers can plan their travels and book flights at
the best prices, while airlines and travel agencies
can optimize their pricing strategies and improve
customer satisfaction.
